    # An SCM module for using Bazaar-NG (bzr) as your source control tool.
    # You can use it by placing the following line in your configuration:
    #
    #   set :scm, :bzr
    #
    # Also, this module accepts a <tt>:bzr</tt> configuration variable,
    # which (if specified) will be used as the full path to the bzr
    # executable on the remote machine:
    #
    #   set :bzr, "/opt/local/bin/bzr"
    class Bzr < Base
      # Return an integer identifying the last known revision in the bzr
      # repository. (This integer is currently the revision number.) 
      def latest_revision
        `#{bzr} revno #{configuration.repository}`.to_i
      end

      # Return the number of the revision currently deployed.

      end

      # Return a string containing the diff between the two revisions. +from+
      # and +to+ may be in any format that bzr recognizes as a valid revision
      # identifier. If +from+ is +nil+, it defaults to the last deployed
      # revision. If +to+ is +nil+, it defaults to the last developed revision.
      # Pay attention to the fact that as of now bzr does NOT support
      # diff on remote locations.
