  module SCM

    # An SCM module for using perforce as your source control tool. 
    # This module can explicitly selected by placing the following line 
    # in your configuration:
    #
    #   set :scm, :perforce
    #
    # Also, this module accepts a <tt>:p4</tt> configuration variable,
    # which (if specified) will be used as the full path to the p4
    # executable on the remote machine:
    #
    #   set :p4, "/usr/local/bin/p4"
    #
    # This module accepts another <tt>:p4sync_flags</tt> configuration 
    # variable, which (if specified) can add extra options. This setting
    # defaults to the value "-f" which forces resynchronization.
    #
    #   set :p4sync_flags, "-f"        
    #
    # This module accepts another <tt>:p4client_root</tt> configuration 
    # variable to handle mapping adjustments.  Perforce doesn't have the 
    # ability to sync to a specific directory (e.g. the release_path); the
    # location being synced to is defined by the client-spec. As such, we 
    # sync the client-spec (defined by <tt>p4client</tt> and then copy from 
    # the determined root of the client-spec mappings to the release_path.
    # In the unlikely event that your client-spec mappings introduces 
    # directory structure above the rails structure, you can override the
    # may need to specify the directory
    #
    #   set :p4client_root, "/user/rmcmahon/project1/code"            
    #
    # Finally, the module accepts a <tt>p4diff2_options</tt> configuration
    # variable. This can be used to manipulate the output when running a
    # diff between what is deployed, and another revision. This option
    # defaults to "-u". Run 'p4 help diff2' for other options.
